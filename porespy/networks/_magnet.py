    r"""
    Perform a Medial Axis Guided Network ExtracTion (MAGNET) on an image of
    porous media.

    This is a modernized python implementation of a classical
    network extraction method. First, the skeleton of the provided image is
    determined. The skeleton can be computed in serial or parallel modes.
    Next, all the junction points of the skeleton are determined by using
    convolution including terminal points on the ends of branches. ClustersPores are
    then inserted at these points. The size of the pores inserted is based on
    the distance transform value at it's junction. This approach results in
    many long throats so more pores are added using a maximum filter along long
    throats to find openings. To ensure an efficient network extraction method,
    only the most fundamential pore and throat properties are returned.

    Parameters
    ------------
    im : ndarray
        An image of the porous material of interest. Be careful of floating
        solids in the 3D image as this will result in a hollow shell after
        taking the skeleton. Floating solids are removed from the image by
        default prior to taking the skeleton.
    sk : ndarray
        Optionally provide your own skeleton of the image. If `sk` is `None` the
        skeleton is computed using `skimage.morphology.skeleton_3d`.  A check
        is made to ensure no shells are found in the resulting skeleton.
    surface : boolean
        If `False` disconnected solid at the surface of the image is NOT
        trimmed. This is the default mode. However, if `True`, disconnected
        solid at the surface of the image is trimmed. This is NOT applied when
        im is 2d.
    parallel : boolean
        If `False` the skeleton is calculated in serial. This is the default
        mode. However, if `True`, the skeleton is calculated in parallel using
        chunking in Dask. The default mode is `False`
    voxel_size : scalar (default = 1)
        The resolution of the image, expressed as the length of one side of a
        voxel, so the volume of a voxel would be voxel_size-cubed
    s : int (default = None)
        The hard threshold for determining "near" junctions. If None is passed,
        then the distance transform is used to merge junctions. The default is
        None.
    l_max : scalar (default = 7)
        The size of the maximum filter used in finding junction along long
        throats. This argument is only used when throat_junctions is set to
        "maximum filter" mode.
    throat_junctions : str
        The mode to use when finding throat junctions. The options are "maximum
        filter" or "fast marching". If None is given, then throat junctions are
        not found (this is the default).
    throat_area: boolean (default = FALSE)
        Set this argument to TRUE to calculate throat area using
        get_throat_area. The area is calculated at the throat voxel with the
        minimum distance transform value. If TRUE, an equivalent throat
        diameter is returned. The default value is FALSE, for computational
        efficiency sake. See get_throat_area() documentation for more
        information.

    Returns
    -------
    net : dict
        A dictionary containing the most important pore and throat size data
        and topological data.
    sk : ndarray
        The skeleton of the image is also returned.
    juncs : ndarray (boolean)
        An ndarray the same shape as `im` with clusters of junction voxels not
        uniquely labelled.
    throat_area : ndarray
        If throat_area argument is set to FALSE (default), then None is
        returned. However, if throat_area is set to TRUE, then the measured
        throat area from get_throat_area is returned here.

    Takes the skeleton of an image. This function ensures that no shells are

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray (boolean)
        Image of porous material where True indicates the void phase and False
        indicates solid
    normals : ndarray, N by im.ndim
        The unit vectors that are perpendicular to the direction that the
        walkers must take. The length of this array must equal the length of
        coords.
    coords : ndarray, N by im.ndim
        The coordinates from which the walkers are to start walking from. These
        coordinates correspond with the normals and as such the length of this
        array must equal the length of normals.
    n_walkers: int (default=10)
        The number of walkers to start from each voxel in throats. If 2D image
        is passed then 2 walkers is used automatically since there are only
        two directions perpendicular to normal in 2D.
    step_size : float or ndarray
        The size of each step to take. This is equivalent to r in spherical
        coordinates. If an ndarray is passed, it is assume that this is the
        distance transform the same shape as im. Pass the distance transform
        if you would like to adaptively effect step size for significant
        speed up.
    max_n_steps : int (optional)
        The maximum number of steps to take. The default is None, in which case
        there is no maximum and the walk will stop when ALL walkers have
        reached solid.

    Returns
    -------
    path: ndarray N_steps by N_walkers by 6
        The array used to keep track of the positions or path that each walker
        takes is returned. Upon each step, this array is incremented by one in
        the first axis. The second axis corresponds to the number of total
        walkers while the third axis contains labels, x-coord, y-coord,
        z-coord, theta, and phi in that order. The labels given to each walker
        are asigned acoording to their starting coordinate. For example, a
        label 1 is assigned to all walkers starting at the first coordinate
        given in coords.

    Parameters

        The skeleton of an image
    throats : ndarray
        An ndarray the same shape as `im` with clusters of throat voxels
        uniquely labelled (1...Nt). If a boolean array is provided then a
        cluster labeling is performed with full cubic connectivity. Walkers are
        sent from each voxel in throats. Therefore, reducing clusters of throat
        voxels beforehand could help reduce computation time but consequently
        will reduce the amount of imformation available. It is important that
        each voxel specified in this image has exactly two neighbours on the
        skeleton!
    voxel_size : scalar (default = 1)
        The resolution of the image, expressed as the length of one side of a
        voxel, so the volume of a voxel would be voxel_size-cubed
    n_walkers: int (default=10)
        The number of walkers to start from each voxel in throats. If 2D image
        is passed then 2 walkers is used automatically since there are only
        two directions perpendicular to normal in 2D.
    step_size : float or ndarray (default=0.5)
        The size of each step to take. This is equivalent to r in spherical
        coordinates. If an ndarray is passed, it is assume that this is the
        distance transform the same shape as im. Pass the distance transform

        The maximum number of steps to take. The default is None, in which case

        reached solid.
